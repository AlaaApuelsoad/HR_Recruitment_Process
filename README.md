Developing Workflow Solutions using IBM Business Automation Workflow V20.0.0.1

This course provided me with deep insights into IBM’s powerful Business Automation Workflow platform, enabling me to design, develop, and deploy robust workflow solutions.

As part of the course, I had the opportunity to work on a complex project: the Hiring Requisition Process. This process aimed to streamline and enhance the company's hiring procedures, ensuring a more efficient and structured approach from job requisition to approval and job posting. Here’s a breakdown of the core business requirements and how I addressed them using IBM Business Automation Workflow:



Business Requirements and Solutions:


1-Hiring Requisition Submission:

- The Hiring Manager submits a requisition with details such as requisition number, date of request, job title, job description, salary offer, and more.

- Solution: Created a user-friendly interface for submitting requisitions, capturing all necessary details accurately.

2-Approval Workflow:

- If the requisition is for a new position, it is forwarded to the General Manager for approval.

- Solution: Implemented an automated routing system to forward requests based on specified criteria, ensuring the correct approvers are engaged.

3-Salary Compliance Check:
- Approved requisitions undergo a salary compliance check.

- Solution: Developed automated compliance checks to validate salary guidelines, reducing manual oversight and ensuring policy adherence.


4-Handling Rejections and Adjustments:

- Rejected salary requests are returned to the Hiring Manager for negotiation or cancellation.

- Solution: Designed a feedback loop allowing Hiring Managers to adjust and resubmit requisitions, facilitating efficient communication and decision-making.


5-Finalization and Posting:

- All requisitions, regardless of approval status, are recorded in the HR Positions database.

- Solution: Ensured all requisitions are documented and posted as required, maintaining a complete and transparent record.


6-Notification System:

- If the HR Administrator doesn’t complete the review within 4 hours, an automated email reminder is sent.

- Solution: Set up automated email notifications to ensure timely reviews and adherence to deadlines.
